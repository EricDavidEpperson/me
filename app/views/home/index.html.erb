    <h1>Who is Eric D. Epperson?</h1>
    <p>I grew up in the U.S. midwest during the rapidly changing 1980's and
      1990's. It was a time when digital technology would begin its diffusion
      into every part of our culture. My childhood straddled, the idyllic
      suburbia of Steven Spielberg's E.T. and the still approaching cyber
      dystopia envisioned in the early works of William Gibson. </p>
    <p>My escapes were Science-Fiction, the heavier the better, and Video Games,
      whether on PC, NES, or Arcade, it didn't matter. When I was able to get my
      first computer I did everything in my power to connect it to the world wide
      web. My first attempts were through AOL, but we all had to start somewhere.</p>
    <p>Graduating from  High School, I took an ill-fortuned try at College,
      exploring Engineering. After 5 semesters of not really applying myself, I
      decided it was time for a break. To eat, I started working in restaurant
      kitchens and found I was good at it. 15 years later I had worked hard to
      become a Chef managing kitchens and restaurants, while making a lot of
      sacrifices both personally and professionally.</p>
    <p>During the time between working as a lowly Pantry Cook, to reaching the
      lofty heights of 'Culinary Mastery' I met and married a beautiful woman from
      South America. Together we embarked on quite a few adventures together,
      enjoying the excitement and the occasional pitfalls of being a couple
      constantly on the move. After nearly 8 years of our journey together, we
      were blessed with an active, smart, precocious baby girl that reminds me
      every day of the wonders that life and growing up present to us all.</p>
